ðŸ”° IaC Adoption Plan: Step-by-Step Breakdown
ðŸŸ¦ Phase 1: Assess & Educate
Step Description

1. Audit current infra	
Identify manual infrastructure management steps, scripts, or cloud console usage. Look for inconsistencies or pain points.
2. Choose a pilot	
Start small with a non-critical resource like a VPC, S3 bucket, or IAM role.
3. Team learning
Dedicate time weekly for training. Use Terraform tutorials, workshops, and documentation to build comfort.

ðŸŸ¨ Phase 2: Start Small
Step	Description
4. Git repo setup	Create a Terraform Git repo. Structure it with modules or directories (e.g., vpc/, network/, main.tf).
5. Basic CI/CD	Use GitHub Actions or another tool to run terraform plan on PRs and terraform apply on merges. Keep it simple.
6. Document everything	Create README files and inline comments. Explain how to initialize, plan, apply, and destroy infrastructure.

ðŸŸ© Phase 3: Expand & Standardize
Step	Description
7. Add more infrastructure	Begin managing EC2, ECS, IAM, RDS, etc., with Terraform. Modularize frequently reused code.
8. Naming & tagging	Establish company-wide naming conventions and AWS tags (e.g., Environment, Owner, Project).
9. Remote state & locking	Configure an S3 bucket for state and a DynamoDB table for state locking to avoid conflicts.

ðŸŸª Phase 4: Normalize & Scale
Step	Description
10. IaC by default	Make IaC the default way to provision new infra. Disallow manual creation in production.
11. Monitor & review	Conduct monthly reviews of IaC usage. Look at deploy times, rollback ease, and incident history.
12. Mentorship & pairing	Encourage collaborationâ€”pair up team members for complex infrastructure changes to share knowledge.

ðŸ§© Tools & Practices
