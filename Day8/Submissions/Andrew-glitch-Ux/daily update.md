## Summary

Completed Lab 9 on Terraform State Locking using S3 backend and DynamoDB table for lock management. Successfully simulated concurrent apply attempts and observed locking behavior.

Completed Lab 10 on Terraform Workspaces, creating isolated environments (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) using a single codebase. Deployed workspace-aware S3 buckets dynamically named with workspace interpolation.

---

## Challenges

- Understanding and configuring the backend locking properly.
- Switching between workspaces and ensuring state isolation.

---

## Accomplishments

- Gained hands-on experience with remote state locking to prevent concurrent changes.
- Learned to manage multiple environments efficiently using Terraform workspaces.

---

## Next Steps

- Create infrastructure diagrams for both labs.
- Start writing detailed blog posts summarizing learnings.

## Time Spent

~1 hour 50 minutes (reading, deploying, testing)
