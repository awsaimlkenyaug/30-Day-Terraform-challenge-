## 📘 Reading

**Book:** Terraform: Up & Running (Chapter 7)  
**Sections Covered:**  
- Working with One Provider  
- What Is a Provider?  
- How Do You Install Providers?  
- How Do You Use Providers?  
- Working with Multiple Copies of the Same Provider  

**Goal:** Understood how providers work in Terraform, how to install and configure them, and how to use aliases for managing multiple configurations of the same provider.

## 🧪 Hands-on Labs

- ✅ Lab 15: Terraform Testing  
- ✅ Lab 16: Terraform CI/CD Integration

## 🛠️ Activity: Provider Configuration

### ✔️ What I Did:
- Configured **two AWS provider blocks** using aliases (`us_east`, `us_west`)  
- Deployed **EC2 instances** in both `us-east-1` and `us-west-2`  
- Ensured AMIs matched each region  
- Used provider version pinning (`~> 5.0`) for stability  

### 🌍 Output:
```hcl
east_instance_id = "i-027ecc4e6581bdabc"
west_instance_id = "i-0655063fa519a1283"
```

Resources were created successfully in both regions, meeting the goal of multi-region infrastructure with provider aliases.
