# 🌍 Daily Update — July 1, 2025

## ✅ Progress Summary

- **Route 53 module finalized**  
  - Hosted zone and record creation fully implemented
  - Two DNS records configured:
    - `app.example.com` → ALB DNS (CNAME)
    - `ec2.example.com` → EC2 Public IP (A record)
  - All values passed through variables, no hardcoded logic
  - Cleaned up any leftover S3 references

- **Variables and Reusability**
  - Refactored `variables.tf` to be fully reusable
  - Used module outputs for record values
  - Ensured consistency in naming and tagging

## 🧹 Cleanup Done
- Removed S3 DNS record logic
- Verified no stray S3 references remain in:
  - `main.tf`
  - `variables.tf`
  - `terraform.tfvars`

## 📌 Next Focus
- Finalize Route 53 module call in `dev/main.tf`
- Test DNS resolution via ALB and EC2 once deployed
- (Optional) Add support for backend S3 website hosting as a separate module later

*Keep modules focused, reusable, and clean — moving forward one day at a time 🚀*
