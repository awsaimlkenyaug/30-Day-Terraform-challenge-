## Overview
Day 10 focused on making Terraform infrastructure dynamic and reusable using `count`, `for_each`, and conditional logic. I refactored my existing EC2 infrastructure to deploy multiple instances using `count`, iterate over environments using `for_each`, and toggle EC2 deployment with a boolean condition.

## Code Highlights
**Multiple EC2s with `count`:**
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "multi" {
  count = var.deploy_ec2 ? var.instance_count : 0
  ami = "ami-04505e74c0741db8d"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ...
}
```

**Instances per environment with `for_each`:**
```hcl
variable "servers" {
  default = {
    dev     = "t2.micro"
    staging = "t2.micro"
    prod    = "t2.small"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "for_each_demo" {
  for_each = var.servers
  ...
  tags = {
    Name = "${each.key}-server"
  }
}
```

## Notes and Observations
- `count` is best for identical resources, `for_each` for distinct ones.
- Used conditionals to prevent EC2 deployment if `deploy_ec2 = false`.
- The infra is now cleaner, dynamic, and easier to extend to multiple environments.
