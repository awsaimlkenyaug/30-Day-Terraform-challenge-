- **GitHub Username:** Denisganga

## Task Completion
- [x] Read Chapter 5 of "Terraform: Up & Running" (Pages 141–160)
    - Sections: "Loops with count and for_each", "Conditionals with Terraform"
- [x] Completed Required Hands-on Labs
    - "Lab 11: Modules"
    - "Lab 12: Module Sources"
- [x] Refactored Terraform code to use loops and conditionals
- [x] Used `count` to deploy multiple instances of the same resource
- [x] Used `for_each` to iterate over maps/lists of resources
- [x] Implemented conditional logic using input variables

## Notes and Observations
- Loops with `count` helped reduce repetition and allowed easy scaling of EC2 instances.
- `for_each` is very useful for iterating over complex data structures like maps of S3 bucket configurations.
- Conditionals made the infrastructure more flexible and environment-specific.
- Using modules with loops improved reusability and organization of the codebase.
- Labs on modules and module sources gave clear hands-on understanding of reusable Terraform components.
