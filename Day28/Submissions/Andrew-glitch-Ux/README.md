# âœ… Day 28 - Terraform Challenge Final Review (Exam Day)

This marks the final checkpoint of the 30-Day Terraform Challenge. Todayâ€™s session focused on reflecting on key Terraform strengths and identifying areas that need deeper focus.

## âœ… Highlights & Strengths

- Mastered Terraform modules with input/output variables
- Confident with Terraform backend state management using S3 + DynamoDB
- Applied infrastructure scaling using Auto Scaling Groups and Launch Templates
- Built production-grade EC2 + ALB architectures in AWS using reusable modules
- Hands-on practice with state isolation and layered environments (`dev`, `prod`)
- Proficient in deploying reusable VPC, Security Group, and ASG modules

## ðŸš§ Weak Areas to Improve

- Tagging tested Git versions (e.g., `v1.0.2`)
- Terratest (automated infrastructure testing)
- Loops in Terraform (e.g., `for_each`, `count`, `for` expressions)
- Git and Jenkins integration for Terraform workflows
- IAM roles defined and managed using Terraform code
- Combining IaC (infrastructure as code) with application code workflows
- Using Route 53 was limited due to lack of domain
