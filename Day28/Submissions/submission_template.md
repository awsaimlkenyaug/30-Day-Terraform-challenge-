## Notes and Observations

### üß† Difficult Questions Faced
- **Workspaces vs. Modules**: Confused in distinguishing when to use one over the other.
- **State management**: Questions on `terraform state` manipulation and `terraform import` were tricky.
- **Provider version constraints**: Missed a question on using `>=`, `~>`, and locking versions properly.
- **Count vs for_each**: A few subtle differences threw me off when applied to `map` inputs.
- **Sensitive data management**: Questions around Vault integration and environment variable best practices.

### üîÅ Revision Plan
- Revisit:
  - Workspace usage scenarios and limitations.
  - State CLI commands using [Terraform CLI docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli).
  - Module versioning from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/).
  - Dynamic blocks, `count`, `for_each` in different resource contexts.
  - Vault integration and `sensitive = true` usage in variables.
