# Day 6 - Daily Update

**Date:** 6/6/2025  
**Duration:** ~7 hours total

### What I worked on today:
- Completed Lab 07 focusing on EC2 instance outputs and fixing resource declaration issues.
- Started and completed Lab 08 on Terraform state management.
- Configured local and remote backends using S3 and DynamoDB.
- Migrated local state to remote successfully.
- Created infrastructure diagrams for both labs to visualize the setups.
- Documented my learnings and observations.

### Challenges:
- Encountered errors due to undeclared resource references in Lab 07, which I resolved by correcting the resource block.
- Ensuring smooth migration of state from local to remote backend required careful backend configuration.

### Next Steps:
- Continue with the next labs in the challenge.
- Begin blogging about my Terraform learning experience.
