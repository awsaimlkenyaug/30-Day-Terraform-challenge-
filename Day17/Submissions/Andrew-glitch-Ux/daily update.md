# 🗓️ Daily Update – Day 19: Integration Testing & Module Path Fixes

## ✅ What We Did
- Performed **integration testing setup** for a modular infrastructure (VPC, ALB, ASG).
- Initialized and tested module blocks using the `examples/` directory.
- Ensured Terraform `init` worked from the correct project root.
- Fixed incorrect relative `source` paths for modules (`../modules/...`).
- Resolved **module input mismatch**: used `asg_name` instead of incorrect `name`.

## 🧠 What We Learned
- `terraform init` must be run from the root folder that **contains all necessary paths** to modules.
- Terraform throws `Unsupported argument` when a module input doesn't match a declared variable.
- Paths like `"../../modules/alb"` or `"../modules/asg"` must correctly point to actual folders.
- Keeping **input variable names consistent** across modules and examples is critical.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Init failed due to unreadable module directory errors (`CreateFile ...modules`).
- Module block for `asg` was red and broken due to mismatched variable `name` vs. `asg_name`.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Snapshot
- **Modules** used:
  - `vpc`: Public subnets with DNS enabled.
  - `alb`: Application Load Balancer with health checks.
  - `asg`: Launch Template + Auto Scaling Group integrated with ALB target group.
- **Security Groups**, **Target Groups**, and **User Data** were passed as inputs for modular control.

## 🔧 Next Steps
- Confirm complete deployment works via `terraform apply`.
- Add integration tests under `test/terratest/` (verify cross-module behavior).
- Clean up any unused variables and streamline input handling in `terraform.tfvars`.

⏳ *Stay consistent. These small fixes are setting the foundation for testable, reusable infra!*
