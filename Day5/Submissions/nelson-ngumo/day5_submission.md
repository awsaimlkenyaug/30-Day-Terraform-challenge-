## Submissions Overview

### âœ… Day 5: Scaling Infrastructure

**Topic:** Scaling Infrastructure and Managing Terraform State

**Key Learnings:**
- Understood how Terraform state tracks infrastructure and avoids unnecessary changes.
- Used the `count` meta-argument to scale multiple EC2 instances.
- Implemented a Load Balancer to distribute traffic.
- Learned about the importance of `terraform show` and `terraform state list` in observing infrastructure state.
- Practiced DRY principles with variables and dynamic subnet selection.

**Terraform Features Used:**
- `aws_lb` to configure Load Balancer
- `aws_instance` with `count` to scale instances
- `data` blocks for AMIs and region info
- `terraform show` to inspect state
- `terraform state list` to view state entries
