# Managing High Traffic Applications with AWS Elastic Load Balancer and Terraform

*Date: June 2, 2025 | Day 5 of 30-Day Terraform Challenge*

## Introduction

As applications grow and user bases expand, the ability to handle increased traffic becomes crucial for maintaining performance and availability. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to build a scalable web infrastructure using AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Terraform, enabling your applications to handle traffic spikes gracefully while maintaining cost efficiency.

## The Challenge of High Traffic

When your application becomes popular, several challenges emerge:

- **Traffic Spikes**: Sudden increases in user activity can overwhelm servers
- **Single Points of Failure**: One server failure can bring down your entire application
- **Performance Degradation**: Increased load can slow response times
- **Cost Management**: Over-provisioning resources wastes money
- **Geographic Distribution**: Users from different regions may experience latency

## Solution Architecture

Our enhanced load balancer solution addresses these challenges through:

### 1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
The ALB serves as the entry point for all traffic, providing:
- **Layer 7 routing** for intelligent traffic distribution
- **Health checks** to ensure traffic only goes to healthy instances
- **SSL termination** for secure connections
- **Geographic distribution** across multiple availability zones

### 2. Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
The ASG automatically manages instance capacity:
- **Dynamic scaling** based on demand
- **Health monitoring** and automatic replacement of failed instances
- **Multi-AZ deployment** for high availability
- **Instance refresh** for zero-downtime updates

### 3. Advanced Scaling Policies
Multiple scaling strategies ensure optimal resource utilization:
- **Target tracking scaling** maintains desired CPU utilization
- **Step scaling** handles sudden traffic spikes
- **CloudWatch alarms** trigger scaling actions based on metrics

## Infrastructure Implementation

Let's examine the key components of our Terraform configuration:

### Application Load Balancer Configuration

```hcl
resource "aws_lb" "main" {
  name               = "${local.cluster_name}-alb"
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  subnets            = data.aws_subnets.default.ids
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.alb.id]
  
  enable_deletion_protection = var.enable_deletion_protection
  
  tags = local.default_tags
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group" "web_servers" {
  name     = "${local.cluster_name}-targets"
  port     = var.server_port
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = data.aws_vpc.default.id

  health_check {
    enabled             = true
    healthy_threshold   = var.health_check_healthy_threshold
    interval            = var.health_check_interval
    matcher             = var.health_check_matcher
    path                = var.health_check_path
    port                = "traffic-port"
    protocol            = "HTTP"
    timeout             = var.health_check_timeout
    unhealthy_threshold = var.health_check_unhealthy_threshold
  }
}
```

This configuration creates an ALB that:
- Distributes traffic across multiple availability zones
- Performs health checks every 30 seconds
- Only routes traffic to healthy instances
- Supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols

### Auto Scaling Group with Launch Template

```hcl
resource "aws_launch_template" "web_servers" {
  name_prefix   = "${local.cluster_name}-"
  image_id      = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.instances.id]
  
  user_data = base64encode(templatefile("${path.module}/user-data.sh", {
    server_port = var.server_port
    server_text = var.server_text
    enable_monitoring = var.enable_detailed_monitoring
    cluster_name = local.cluster_name
  }))

  block_device_mappings {
    device_name = "/dev/xvda"
    ebs {
      volume_size           = var.ebs_volume_size
      volume_type          = var.ebs_volume_type
      encrypted            = var.enable_ebs_encryption
      delete_on_termination = true
    }
  }

  monitoring {
    enabled = var.enable_detailed_monitoring
  }
}

resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "web_servers" {
  name                = "${local.cluster_name}-asg"
  vpc_zone_identifier = data.aws_subnets.default.ids
  target_group_arns   = [aws_lb_target_group.web_servers.arn]
  health_check_type   = "ELB"
  health_check_grace_period = var.health_check_grace_period

  min_size         = var.min_size
  max_size         = var.max_size
  desired_capacity = var.desired_capacity

  instance_refresh {
    strategy = "Rolling"
    preferences {
      min_healthy_percentage = 50
      instance_warmup       = "300"
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Scaling Policies

#### Target Tracking Scaling
```hcl
resource "aws_autoscaling_policy" "target_tracking" {
  name               = "${local.cluster_name}-target-tracking"
  autoscaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.web_servers.name
  policy_type       = "TargetTrackingScaling"

  target_tracking_configuration {
    predefined_metric_specification {
      predefined_metric_type = "ASGAverageCPUUtilization"
    }
    target_value = var.cpu_target_percentage
  }
}
```

#### Step Scaling for Traffic Spikes
```hcl
resource "aws_autoscaling_policy" "scale_up" {
  name                   = "${local.cluster_name}-scale-up"
  adjustment_type        = "ChangeInCapacity"
  autoscaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.web_servers.name
  policy_type           = "StepScaling"

  step_adjustment {
    scaling_adjustment          = var.scale_up_adjustment
    metric_interval_lower_bound = 0
  }
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "high_cpu" {
  alarm_name          = "${local.cluster_name}-high-cpu"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = var.high_cpu_evaluation_periods
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = var.cloudwatch_alarm_period
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = var.high_cpu_threshold
  alarm_actions       = [aws_autoscaling_policy.scale_up.arn]

  dimensions = {
    AutoScalingGroupName = aws_autoscaling_group.web_servers.name
  }
}
```
