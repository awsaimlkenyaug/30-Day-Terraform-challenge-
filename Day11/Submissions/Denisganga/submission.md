## 📖 Reading Assignment

**Completed:** Chapter 5 (Pages 160–169)  
**Section:** "Conditionals with Terraform"

Learned how conditionals in Terraform help make infrastructure deployments flexible and environment-specific. Understood the use of logical expressions to manage when and how resources are provisioned based on regions, environments, and feature flags.

## 🧪 Hands-on Labs

### ✅ Lab 12: Module Sources

Explored how to use both remote and local module sources in Terraform. Practiced integrating modules from external registries and understood how to manage different source types efficiently.

### ✅ Lab 13: Module Composition

Successfully combined multiple modules into a single configuration. Learned the importance of modular design for reusability and maintainability of infrastructure code.

---

## ⚙️ Activity: Conditional Infrastructure Deployment

Refactored existing Terraform configurations to include conditionals. The deployment was made dynamic by allowing certain resources to be created only when specific conditions were met — such as when targeting a particular environment or region, or when a feature flag was enabled.

This approach helped reduce the risk of accidental deployments and improved overall infrastructure control.
