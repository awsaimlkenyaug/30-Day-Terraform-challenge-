- **Instance Type**: t3.medium
- **Scaling**: 2 min, 10 max, 4 desired
- **Features**: Full monitoring, deletion protection, enhanced security
- **VPC CIDR**: 10.2.0.0/16

## 📊 Comparative Analysis

### Workspace Isolation
**Pros:**
- Single codebase maintenance
- No code duplication
- Quick environment switching
- Consistent logic across environments

**Cons:**
- Complex conditional logic
- Shared backend access
- Risk of wrong workspace deployment
- Limited configuration flexibility

### File Layout Isolation
**Pros:**
- Complete environment separation
- Maximum configuration flexibility
- Independent state management
- Clear security boundaries

**Cons:**
- Code duplication across environments
- Higher maintenance overhead
- Multiple backend configurations
- Consistency challenges

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Features
