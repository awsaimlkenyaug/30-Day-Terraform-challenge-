## Key Learning Points
- Understanding the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in infrastructure
- Data sources allow fetching information about existing AWS resources
- Variables make Terraform configurations reusable and environment-agnostic
- Input variables, outputs, and data sources are fundamental for scalable IaC

## Current Focus
Working on implementing configurable web server with proper variable usage and then moving to clustered architecture for high availability.

## Challenges & Solutions
- [To be updated as challenges arise]

## Next Steps
1. Create configurable web server Terraform configuration
2. Implement clustered web server with Auto Scaling Group and Load Balancer
3. Generate architecture diagrams
4. Complete documentation and blog post
