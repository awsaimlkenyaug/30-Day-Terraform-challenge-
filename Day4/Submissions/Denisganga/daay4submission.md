# Day 4 Submission

## Personal Information
- **Name:** Denis Nganga  
- **Date:** 31/05/2025  
- **GitHub Username:** Denisganga  

## Task Completion
- [x] Read Chapter 2 of *Terraform: Up & Running*  
- [x] Completed Required Hands-on Labs (Terraform Variables and AWS Subnet Deployment)  
- [x] Deployed Single Server (Subnet Resource with Variables)  
- [x] Deployed Web Server  
- [x] Created Infrastructure Diagrams  

## Infrastructure Details

### Single Server Deployment
- **Region:** us-east-1  
- **Instance Type:** N/A (Subnet resource deployed; EC2 instance deployment is next)  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Created an AWS subnet within a specified VPC  
  - Used Terraform variables for subnet CIDR block, availability zone, and public IP assignment  
  - Configured default values for variables to improve reusability and ease of deployment  

### Web Server Deployment
- **Region:** us-east-1  
- **Instance Type:** t3.micro  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Deployed EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2 with Apache HTTP server  
  - Used user data script to automate HTTPD installation and service start  
  - Configured security group to allow ICMP (ping) and SSH traffic  

## Infrastructure Diagrams
Infrastructure diagrams were created using **Terraform graph** output and converted with **Graphviz's dot tool**.  
The diagrams (`graph.dot` converted to `graph.png`) illustrate the deployed resources and their relationships.

## Notes and Observations
Working with Terraform variables introduced me to how powerful parameterization can make infrastructure code. Initially, hard-coded values worked fine, but converting these to variables made the deployment flexible and reusable across different environments. Managing defaults helped reduce the friction during deployment while still allowing customization. A key challenge was understanding how changes to variables trigger resource replacement, which I overcame by carefully reviewing Terraform's plan output and documentation.

Creating diagrams with Terraform graph and Graphviz required installing Graphviz (`dot` command). This visualization helped me better understand resource dependencies and the overall architecture.

## Additional Resources Used
- *Terraform: Up & Running* by Yevgeniy Brikman, Chapter 2  
- Terraform official documentation on variables  
- AWS VPC and subnet documentation  
- Graphviz official documentation for generating diagrams  

## Time Spent
- Reading: 1.5 hours  
- Infrastructure Deployment: 2 hours  
- Diagram Creation: 0.5 hours  
- Blog Writing: 1 hour  
- Total: 5 hours

The diagrams were generated by running:

```bash
terraform graph > graph.dot
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install graphviz -y
dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png
```
