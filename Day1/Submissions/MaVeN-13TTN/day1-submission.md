## Notes and Observations
During this first day, I learned about the core concepts of Infrastructure as Code and why it's transforming how we manage cloud resources. The ability to version control infrastructure just like application code is a game-changer for maintaining consistency and reliability. I faced some initial challenges with AWS CLI configuration but resolved them by carefully following the documentation.
