## Notes and Observations

While learning Terraform, I gained a clear understanding of what Infrastructure as Code (IaC) really means and why Terraform is such a powerful tool for automating cloud infrastructure. One of the key takeaways was understanding how Terraform uses declarative configuration files to manage infrastructure, which allows for consistent, repeatable deployments across environments.

A challenge I faced was dealing with AWS subnet creation — specifically, CIDR block conflicts. Initially, I struggled to create my own subnets because the default ones already existed and overlapped with mine. It wasn't obvious at first how to remove or work around these pre-existing subnets, especially since they were part of the default VPC. I also faced issues setting environment variables and getting Terraform to recognize AWS credentials on Windows PowerShell. These problems were frustrating but valuable learning opportunities.

I overcame these challenges by taking things one step at a time, researching the errors, and learning how to set environment variables properly in PowerShell and configure my AWS CLI credentials. Installing Terraform and adding it to the system path was another hurdle, but after resolving it, I was able to successfully initialize Terraform and begin building infrastructure confidently.
