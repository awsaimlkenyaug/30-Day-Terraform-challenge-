## Notes and Observations

### Key Learnings:
1. Terraform's declarative syntax makes infrastructure provisioning intuitive
2. AWS CLI configuration is crucial for Terraform to work properly
3. IAM permissions can be tricky - always verify permissions before troubleshooting other issues

### Challenges Faced:
- Initially struggled with IAM permissions (403 errors)
- Had to learn about AWS security groups to allow web traffic
- Understanding Terraform state management was initially confusing

### Solutions:
- Created custom IAM policy with specific EC2 permissions
- Studied AWS security group documentation
- Practiced with `terraform state` commands to understand state management
