## Notes and Observations
[I learned how to perform installations using PowerShell and Chocolatey, which was new to me. Setting up Terraform through Chocolatey and configuring it with AWS helped me understand how infrastructure tools integrate with the cloud. I also learned how to clone a GitHub repository and set it up locally, which improved my confidence in using Git and version control effectively.]
